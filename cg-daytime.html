      <h1 class="content-title">Daytime Compression Garments</h1>
      <p>
        Daytime compression garments are designed to help control swelling and support
        circulation while you are upright and active. They are often used for patients
        with lymphedema, venous insufficiency, or chronic edema of the arms, legs, or
        trunk.
      </p>
      <p>
        These garments provide a graduated level of compression, with the greatest
        support usually at the farthest part of the limb and slightly less as the
        garment moves closer to the body. This assists the natural movement of fluid
        back toward the central circulation throughout the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Great Lakes works with patients and providers to select appropriate garment
        styles, sizes, and materials based on limb measurements, diagnosis, activity
        level, and skin condition.

    <!-- Section 2: Fit, Use, and Care -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">Fit, Use, and Care</h1>
      <p>
        Proper fit is essential for comfort and effectiveness. Garments are sized using
        detailed limb measurements, and in some cases custom-made options are used when
        standard sizes do not provide an appropriate fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your referring therapist or provider will recommend how long to wear your
        daytime garments each day. Many patients put them on in the morning after
        swelling has decreased and remove them in the evening. Wearing instructions
        should always follow the guidance of your healthcare provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Garments should be washed regularly according to the manufacturer’s
        instructions to maintain elasticity and hygiene. During your fitting or
        equipment visit, Great Lakes staff can review donning techniques, use of
        donning aids, and tips to protect your skin.

    <!-- Section 3: Who May Benefit -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">Who May Benefit from Daytime Garments</h1>
      <p>
        Daytime compression garments may be appropriate for patients who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have lymphedema or chronic swelling of an arm, leg, or trunk</li>
        <li>Have venous insufficiency or varicose veins with edema</li>
        <li>Are transitioning from intensive therapy to a home maintenance program</li>
        <li>Need consistent daytime support to help maintain limb volume</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The type, compression level, and wearing schedule of your garments are
        determined by your provider or therapist. Our role is to help make sure your
        garments fit correctly, feel as comfortable as possible, and support your
        long-term treatment goals.
