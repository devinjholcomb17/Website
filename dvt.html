      <h1 class="content-title">What Is Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)?</h1>
      <p>
        Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, most
        often in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. When a clot develops, it can
        partially or completely block normal blood flow, causing pain and swelling
        in the affected limb.
      </p>
      <p>
        DVT is a serious condition because a portion of the clot can break loose and
        travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE). A PE is a medical
        emergency and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early diagnosis and treatment of DVT are critical to protect circulation,
        reduce symptoms, and help prevent long-term complications such as chronic
        swelling, pain, or skin changes known as post-thrombotic syndrome.

    <!-- Section 2: Signs and Symptoms -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">Common Signs and Symptoms</h1>
      <p>
        Not every DVT causes noticeable symptoms, but many patients experience
        changes in the affected leg. Common features can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Swelling in one leg (or arm), often developing over hours to days</li>
        <li>Pain, tenderness, or cramping that may worsen when standing or walking</li>
        <li>Warmth, redness, or discoloration of the skin over the affected area</li>
        <li>Veins that appear more prominent or feel firm and sensitive to touch</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE) may include sudden shortness of breath,
        chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, rapid heartbeat, coughing up
        blood, lightheadedness, or fainting. <strong>These symptoms are an emergency</strong>
        and require immediate medical attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who suspects a DVT or PE should seek urgent evaluation from a
        healthcare professional. Diagnosis typically involves imaging studies and
        blood tests, followed by medication and close follow-up.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Compression Therapy and DVT -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">Compression Therapy and DVT</h1>
      <p>
        Compression therapy is often used to help manage swelling, support venous
        circulation, and reduce symptoms after a DVT has been diagnosed and treated.
        In the early, acute phase, decisions about compression are made by the
        treating physician or vascular specialist based on the individual patient’s
        condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once medically cleared, graduated compression stockings or pneumatic
        compression devices may be used to help control swelling, improve comfort,
        and lower the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome. Proper fit and consistent
        use are important for obtaining the best results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Great Lakes collaborates closely with referring providers to ensure that any
        compression therapy is safe, appropriate, and tailored to each patient’s
        needs. Compression devices should <strong>never</strong> be started, stopped,
        or adjusted without guidance from the healthcare team managing the DVT.
        Patients should promptly report new or worsening pain, swelling, or changes
        in skin color to their provider.
