      <p>Chronic venous problems including venous insufficiency and venous stasis are also treated effectively 
        with compression therapy. Venous insufficiency occurs as a result of faulty or damaged venous valves 
        permitting a backflow of blood, causing pain, swelling, ulcers and pigmentation changes. Venous stasis 
        is the slowing or stoppage of blood flow.</p>
      <p>Left untreated, lymphedema and venous problems can lead to other serious problems including infection, 
        fibrosis, pain, skin breakdown, functional disability.</p>
      <p>Venous stasis ulcerations are normally located on the inside of the ankle area. The wound can start out 
        small and continue to increase in size if left untreated. Removing the edema will allow for oxygen and 
        other nutrients to reach the damaged tissue and enable the wound to begin healing.</p>
      <p>Compression therapy has been clinically proven to treat chronic venous insufficiency and edema and heal 
        venous stasis ulcerations by promoting venous blood flow and enhancing systemic fibrinolytic activity.</p>
