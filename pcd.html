          Great Lakes supplies BioCompression external compression systems throughout Michigan.
          The Sequential Circulator SC 4008 DL is a digital calibrated gradient pressure 8–16 chamber pump
          that utilizes a 60–120-second cycle time. The appliances for the arm or leg inflate sequentially
          from distal to proximal, providing a medically-correct tissue massage to increase circulation and
          reduce swelling comfortably by applying programmed pressures in each chamber to achieve a specific
          individual treatment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The BioCompression BioComfort arm appliance is specially designed with a shoulder piece that
          inflates to help move fluid into the body. The BioComfort leg appliance utilizes straps and a
          zipper for easy donning. This system is designed for safe and easy home use as prescribed by a
          physician. BioCompression pneumatic compression devices are supported by published long-term
          clinical research studies and are referenced in current vascular teaching textbooks.
        </p>

        <p>
          BioCompression also makes the Sequential Circulator in a digital calibrated, nongradient pump
          with preprogrammed gradiency in the eight-chamber version we provide. These sequential pneumatic
          compression systems are specially designed for optimal reduction and management of peripheral edema,
          mild lymphedema and ulceration associated with venous insufficiency by utilizing fast distal-to-proximal
          flow and comfortable compression.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many therapists, clinics and teaching hospitals use BioCompression pumps in conjunction with other
          treatments such as Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD). Some BioCompression pumps incorporate a unique
          pre-treatment cycle based on the principles of manual lymph drainage, which helps empty the proximal
          lymphatics prior to treatment; then transition to calibrated gradient compression, a highly effective
          treatment for maximum results and comfort; and finish with pre-treatment. These models are compatible
          with all BioCompression garments.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pcd-subheader">BioCompression Garments</h2>

        <p>
          The Bio Vest and Jacket allow for effective treatment of the shoulder, upper back, arm and chest area.
          Bio Pants are custom-designed to treat the abdomen, trunk, scrotal area and legs for each patient based on
          their individual measurements. These pants can be used on patients who have swelling in one or both lower
          extremities.
        </p>
