      <h1 class="content-title">Pneumatic Compression for Arterial Disease</h1>
      <p>
        In selected cases of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), pneumatic
        compression may be used as part of a comprehensive plan to improve
        circulation, support wound healing, and reduce symptoms such as pain
        with walking. These devices must always be used under the guidance of
        a vascular specialist or treating provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before compression is considered, your arterial blood flow is evaluated
        through clinical examination and vascular testing. This ensures that
        any compression therapy is safe, appropriate, and consistent with your
        overall treatment goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Great Lakes Medical works closely with referring providers to identify
        patients who may benefit from pneumatic compression and to configure
        settings and garment options based on the provider’s orders.

    <!-- Section 2: How It Works -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">How the Device Works</h1>
      <p>
        For appropriate patients, an arterial-focused pneumatic compression
        device delivers intermittent pressure at the foot, calf, or leg. This
        can help promote blood flow through the arteries, support tissue
        oxygenation, and complement other treatments prescribed by the
        vascular team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pressure settings, inflation patterns, and treatment duration are
        determined by your provider. During setup, a Great Lakes representative
        will review your prescribed protocol, demonstrate safe use, and answer
        questions about comfort and positioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        These devices are intended to work alongside, not replace, other
        medical therapies such as risk factor management, medications, or
        revascularization procedures when indicated.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Who May Benefit -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">Who May Benefit</h1>
      <p>
        Pneumatic compression for arterial disease may be considered for
        patients who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have documented peripheral arterial disease (PAD)</li>
        <li>Are under the active care of a vascular specialist or provider</li>
        <li>Have non-healing wounds or rest pain where compression is prescribed</li>
        <li>Have been specifically evaluated and cleared for this type of therapy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Compression devices should <strong>never</strong> be used on a limb
        with critical ischemia or severely reduced arterial blood flow unless
        explicitly ordered by the treating provider. Any new pain, color
        change, or coolness should be reported immediately to the care team.
