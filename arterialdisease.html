      <h1 class="content-title">What Is Arterial Disease?</h1>
      <p>
        Arterial disease, often referred to as peripheral arterial disease (PAD), occurs
        when the arteries that carry blood away from the heart become narrowed or
        blocked by plaque buildup. This reduced blood flow most commonly affects the
        legs and feet, but can also involve the arms and other areas of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        When tissues do not receive enough oxygen-rich blood, patients may experience
        pain with walking, cramping, numbness, slow-healing wounds, or skin changes.
        Left untreated, significant arterial disease can lead to non-healing ulcers,
        infection, and in severe cases, tissue loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early evaluation and ongoing management are essential to protect circulation,
        reduce symptoms, and help prevent complications. Great Lakes works closely with
        referring providers to support safe, effective care for patients living with
        arterial disease.

    <!-- Section 2: Signs and Symptoms -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">Common Signs and Symptoms</h1>
      <p>
        Symptoms can vary from mild to severe, and some people may not notice any
        problems early on. Common features of peripheral arterial disease can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pain, cramping, or tiredness in the calves, thighs, or buttocks when walking</li>
        <li>Numbness, weakness, or heaviness in the legs or feet</li>
        <li>Cool, pale, or discolored skin on the lower legs or toes</li>
        <li>Wounds or ulcers on the feet or ankles that heal slowly or not at all</li>
        <li>Decreased hair growth or thickened nails on the legs and feet</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anyone experiencing these symptoms should speak with a healthcare professional
        for a full evaluation. Prompt diagnosis allows providers to create a treatment
        plan that may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures to improve
        blood flow.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 3: Compression and Arterial Disease -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">Compression Therapy and Arterial Disease</h1>
      <p>
        Compression therapy is commonly used to support venous and lymphatic circulation.
        In patients with arterial disease, however, compression must be used carefully
        and only under the guidance of a medical provider. The level of arterial blood
        flow must be evaluated before any compression garments or devices are prescribed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When appropriate and medically cleared, compression can be part of a broader
        plan to manage swelling, support wound healing, and improve comfort. Great Lakes
        coordinates closely with physicians, vascular specialists, and wound care teams
        to ensure that all compression therapy is safe, properly fitted, and tailored to
        each patient’s circulation status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compression devices should <strong>never</strong> be used on a limb with critical
        ischemia or severely reduced arterial blood flow unless specifically directed by
        the treating provider. Patients should always contact their physician if they
        notice new pain at rest, color changes, coolness, or worsening wounds.
