      <h1 class="content-title">The Lymphatic System</h1>
      <p>The lymphatic system is part of the circulatory system and consists primarily of 
        lymph vessels, nodes and tissues. Networks of the lymphatic system are located throughout the body. 
        The lymphatic system removes impurities from the circulatory system and produces cells necessary in 
        fighting various bacteria and viruses that can cause infections such as cellulitis.</p>
      <p>Lymph vessels are channels containing colorless fluid called lymph. Lymph is comprised of white 
        blood cells and waste products for lymph tissue. Lymph fluid passes through valves located in the 
        lymph vessels. As fluid passes through these nodes, harmful bacteria and viruses are removed.</p>
      <p>Left untreated, lymphedema and venous problems can lead to other serious problems including infection, 
        fibrosis, pain, skin breakdown, functional disability.</p>

      <h1 class="content-title">Primary and Secondary Lymphadema</h1>
      <p>Primary lymphedema may be congenital in nature or present at birth. It is more common during the second 
        and third decades of life and is called lymphedema praecox. Milroy's disease is a chronic hereditary 
        condition and presents at or near birth. In some cases it develops after the age of 35 and is called 
        lymphedema tarda. Secondary lymphedema is the result of damage to the lymphatic system for a variety of 
        reasons including surgery, trauma, radiation and infection. Surgical procedures interrupting normal 
        lymphatic function such as surgery for cancer in the breast or groin areas may prevent lymph fluid 
        flowing naturally through its system. A traumatic injury may affect the lymphatic system, damaging the 
        normal flow of lymphatic fluid. Radiation therapy can damage an otherwise healthy lymphatic system by 
        causing scar tissue to form, subsequently interrupting the normal flow of lymphatic fluid. In addition, 
        repeated episodes of infection can cause progressive closure of the lymphatic system, thus worsening the 
        condition.</p>
