      <h1 class="content-title">Pneumatic Compression After DVT</h1>
      <p>
        After a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been diagnosed and treated,
        pneumatic compression may be used to help manage chronic swelling,
        improve comfort, and reduce the risk of long-term complications such
        as post-thrombotic syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
        These devices are typically introduced once the treating provider
        confirms that it is safe to do so, taking into account the location of
        the clot, current medications, and your overall clinical status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Great Lakes Medical supports patients and providers by supplying
        appropriate compression systems, training on home use, and assisting
        with documentation for coverage when available.

    <!-- Section 2: How It Works -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">How the Device Works</h1>
      <p>
        A venous pneumatic compression device gently squeezes the limb in a
        controlled pattern to support blood flow back toward the heart. This
        can help reduce residual swelling, support comfort, and promote venous
        return after a DVT, when prescribed by your provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        During your equipment visit, a Great Lakes representative will review
        how to apply the garment, operate the device, and follow the treatment
        schedule recommended by your physician or specialist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Devices are intended to complement, not replace, medical therapies such
        as anticoagulation, lifestyle changes, and other interventions ordered
        by your care team.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Who May Benefit -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">Who May Benefit</h1>
      <p>
        Pneumatic compression after DVT may be considered for patients who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a history of deep vein thrombosis in the leg</li>
        <li>Experience ongoing swelling, heaviness, or discomfort</li>
        <li>Are at risk for or have signs of post-thrombotic syndrome</li>
        <li>Have been evaluated and cleared by the treating provider for compression</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Compression therapy should always follow the recommendations of the
        healthcare team managing the DVT. Any sudden increase in swelling,
        pain, or shortness of breath should be treated as urgent and reported
        immediately.
