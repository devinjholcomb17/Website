      <h1 class="content-title">Pneumatic Compression for Lymphedema</h1>
      <p>
        Pneumatic compression devices are designed to gently move fluid out of
        congested tissues and back into the circulatory system. For patients
        living with lymphedema, these devices can help reduce swelling, improve
        comfort, and support daily activities at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment is typically ordered by your provider as part of a complete
        lymphedema management program that may also include compression garments,
        exercise, elevation, and skin care. The goal is to control swelling,
        protect the skin, and improve quality of life over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Great Lakes Medical works with patients, therapists, and physicians to
        select appropriate devices and garment styles based on limb involvement,
        severity of swelling, functional goals, and insurance guidelines.

    <!-- Section 2: How It Works -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">How the Device Works</h1>
      <p>
        A lymphedema pneumatic compression device uses a garment with multiple
        air chambers that inflate and deflate in a specific sequence. This
        creates a gentle, wave-like motion that helps move lymphatic fluid from
        the limb toward the central circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your referring provider will prescribe the pressure settings and
        recommended treatment time. During a teaching visit, a Great Lakes
        representative will review how to position the garment, operate the
        device, and follow your prescribed routine safely at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        When used consistently, these devices can support long-term volume
        reduction and help maintain the results of in-clinic therapy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Who May Benefit -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">Who May Benefit</h1>
      <p>
        Pneumatic compression for lymphedema may be appropriate for patients who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have primary or secondary lymphedema of the arm, leg, or trunk</li>
        <li>Experience persistent swelling despite conservative measures</li>
        <li>Have completed or are actively engaged in lymphedema therapy</li>
        <li>Need a home-based option to help maintain limb volume</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Final decisions about device type, garment style, and treatment plan are
        made by your referring provider. Our role is to support that plan with
        appropriate equipment, education, and follow-up.
