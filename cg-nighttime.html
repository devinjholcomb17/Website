      <h1 class="content-title">Nighttime Compression Garments</h1>
      <p>
        Nighttime compression garments are designed to provide gentle, sustained
        support while you rest. They help maintain the gains achieved during daytime
        wear or therapy sessions and can be an important part of a 24-hour
        lymphedema or edema management plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        These garments are typically made from softer, more cushioned materials than
        many daytime options and are structured to be comfortable when lying or
        sleeping. They may include adjustable straps, foam inserts, or quilting
        patterns to help distribute pressure evenly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Great Lakes works with therapists and providers to match nighttime garments
        to each patient’s limb shape, skin tolerance, and treatment goals.

    <!-- Section 2: How They Are Used -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">How Nighttime Garments Are Used</h1>
      <p>
        Nighttime compression is usually worn while resting or sleeping, as directed
        by your provider or therapist. The goal is to support limb volume when you
        are no longer upright and moving, helping to prevent fluid from reaccumulating
        overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
        During your fitting, Great Lakes staff will demonstrate how to apply and
        remove the garment, review any straps or closures, and discuss how to
        position the limb for comfort and safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patients should always follow their provider’s guidance regarding how many
        hours per night to wear the garment and when to pause use—for example, if
        there are any changes in skin condition, pain, or new medical issues.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 3: Who May Benefit -->
    <div class="content">
      <h1 class="content-title">Who May Benefit from Nighttime Garments</h1>
      <p>
        Nighttime compression garments may be recommended for patients who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have moderate to severe lymphedema requiring 24-hour volume management</li>
        <li>Experience increased swelling overnight or upon waking</li>
        <li>Have completed intensive therapy and need long-term maintenance strategies</li>
        <li>Require a softer, more cushioned option than daytime garments while sleeping</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The choice between daytime, nighttime, or a combination of both types of
        garments is individualized. Your therapist or provider will determine what
        is most appropriate for your condition, and Great Lakes will help ensure your
        garments fit well and are easy to incorporate into your daily routine.
