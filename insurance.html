      <h2 class="content-title">Working With Your Insurance</h2>
      <p>
        Great Lakes Medical works with most Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance plans.
        Our goal is to make the process as simple as possible for both patients and providers,
        while helping you understand your coverage before any equipment is delivered.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a provider places an order or sends a referral, we verify that your information is
        current and correct, review your plan’s benefits, and communicate any requirements
        or patient responsibility prior to delivery.
      </p>

      <h2 class="content-title" style="margin-top: 2rem;">What We Verify</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Eligibility and active coverage with your insurance plan</li>
        <li>Whether the equipment is a covered benefit under your policy</li>
        <li>Any prior authorization or documentation requirements</li>
        <li>Applicable deductibles, copays, and coinsurance amounts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our staff works directly with your referring provider and insurance company to obtain
        authorizations when required and to help ensure all criteria are met before billing.
      </p>

      <h2 class="content-title" style="margin-top: 2rem;">Understanding Coinsurance & Out-of-Pocket Costs</h2>
      <p>
        Many insurance plans share the cost of covered services between the plan and the subscriber.
        After any deductible has been met, your plan may pay a percentage of the allowed amount and
        you may be responsible for the remaining percentage, known as coinsurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if your plan covers 80% of an approved charge, the remaining 20% is your
        coinsurance. We are required by law to make a good-faith effort to collect all copays and
        coinsurance amounts as outlined by your plan.
      </p>

      <h2 class="content-title" style="margin-top: 2rem;">Payment Plans & Financial Assistance</h2>
      <p>
        We understand that out-of-pocket expenses can be challenging. Great Lakes offers payment
        plans to help patients manage coinsurance or other balances that are not covered by
        insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have concerns about cost or a potential financial hardship, please contact our
        office at <strong>517-536-7350</strong> before delivery so we can review available options
        and discuss our financial hardship policy with you.
      </p>

      <h2 class="content-title" style="margin-top: 2rem;">Your Role in the Process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate insurance, contact, and physician information</li>
        <li>Notify us if your insurance, address, or physician changes</li>
        <li>Review any estimated out-of-pocket costs we share with you</li>
        <li>Contact our office if you receive statements or have questions about a bill</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our team is here to help you understand your benefits and to support you throughout
        the process—from referral and coverage verification through delivery and ongoing care.
