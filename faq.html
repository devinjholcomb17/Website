              Most compression therapy products are covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial
              insurance plans and have specific guidelines that need to be met for coverage.

              Our company will work directly with your referring provider and insurance company to

              Once we receive a referral, our office will verify your coverage with your insurance and
              communicate any patient responsibility to you before delivery.

              We will also ensure all appropriate steps are followed to help eliminate payment denials

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              A coinsurance is the subscriber's share of a covered expense. Some plans have a deductible
              that has to be met first, then a set amount of coverage in a percentage applies until the
              plan's out-of-pocket maximum amount has been met for the policy year.
            </p>
            <p>
              If that percentage is 80%, then the coinsurance would be 20%. We are required by law to
              attempt to collect all coinsurances.

              Using compression therapy in the home is convenient, comfortable, and effective
              at reducing swelling, increasing circulation, healing wounds, and reducing the
              secondary risk of infection from fluid build-up in the tissues under the skin.

              Pneumatic compression devices require that the pressure setting and length of

              Compression garments need to be removed before pumping. Loose cotton sweatpants or
              pajama pants along with a loose cotton sock, or stockinette, can be worn for
              lower extremity pumping.
            </p>
            <p>
              A long-sleeved shirt, or cotton stockinette, can be worn for upper extremity pumping.
              Do not pump over bare skin as bacteria can build up over time and potentially cause
              cellulitis.
